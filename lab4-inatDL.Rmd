# Lab 4 Deep Learning: iNaturalist

# Setup

# 1. 2 Species (binary classification) - neural net. Draw from 3.4 üçø Movies (binary classification). You‚Äôll need to pre-process the images to be a consistent shape first though ‚Äì see 5.2.4 Data preprocessing.

# 2. 2 Species (binary classification) - convolutional neural net. Draw from the dogs vs cats example.

# 3. 10 Species (multi-class classification) - neural net. Draw from 3.5 üì∞ Newswires (multi-class classification).

# 4. 10 Species (multi-class classification) - convolutional neural net. Draw from dogs vs cats example and update necessary values to go from binary to mult-class classification
