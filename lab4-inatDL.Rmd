# Lab 4 Deep Learning: iNaturalist

The main lab that you'll turn in is to apply these techniques to a small subset of the iNaturalist species imagery. These data were downloaded from the links provided at [github.com/visipedia/inat_comp:2021/](https://github.com/visipedia/inat_comp/tree/master/2021). Of all the 10,000 species and many images for each from training (Train), training mini (Train Mini), validation (Val) and test images, you'll draw only from the Train Mini set of images:

# Setup

Here I am generating which species I am going to use

# 1. 2 Species (binary classification) - neural net. Draw from 3.4 üçø Movies (binary classification). You‚Äôll need to pre-process the images to be a consistent shape first though ‚Äì see 5.2.4 Data preprocessing.

# 2. 2 Species (binary classification) - convolutional neural net. Draw from the dogs vs cats example.

# 3. 10 Species (multi-class classification) - neural net. Draw from 3.5 üì∞ Newswires (multi-class classification).

# 4. 10 Species (multi-class classification) - convolutional neural net. Draw from dogs vs cats example and update necessary values to go from binary to mult-class classification
